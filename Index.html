        <p> My hobby is reading books. Books are really interesting. My favorite genre is Fiction. Fiction books are really exiting, and people can also learn different life lessons. I am 9 years old and in 4th grade. Whenever I get some free time, I read books. Some classics that I already read is Oliver twist, 20 leagues under the sea, The adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Journey to the center of the Earth, and many more.</p>
